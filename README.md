# TetheredRing
A Tethered Ring is a dynamic structure that can cost-effectively support space launch facilities, transportation infrastructure, and a sizable human settlement at high altitudes. An altitude of 32 km and a population of 250,000 is shown to be achievable using circa 2017 science and technology.  The structure resembles a pipeline formed into a ring having a diameter similar to that of Earth’s moon. It stays aloft primarily by generating and properly combining inertial forces with tensile forces to offset the pull of gravity. The inertial forces are produced by the circular motion of magnetically levitated rings within the pipeline, and the tensile forces are generated by appropriately tethering the pipelines to the planet using stays made of strong, light-weight, industrial fiber.  The entire structure can be fabricated on Earth and neither its construction nor its deployment depends on a pre-existing space infrastructure or space-based industry. The deployed structure is resilient to catastrophic failure because its precision-guided fast moving components are: a) not exposed to seismic or climatic battering, and b) safely above and thus out of range of tacit civilizational threats, such attacks involving torpedoes or commandeered aircraft.  The tethered ring is an optimal “stepping stone” infrastructure for furnishing humanity with a safe, affordable, and sustainable means to escape Earth’s gravity, expand its civilization into space, and ultimately evolve into a multi-planetary species.

This is a great tutorial on getting started with Three.js: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1Sw_hnm58&ab_channel=ChrisCourses.

Steps involved:
1.	Create a directory where you want to put the model on your PC. For example: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Three.js\Project1
2.	Copy the latest version of the project into this directory and unzip the file (you will need to receive an up-to-date OneDrive link for this step).
3.	Install git from: Git - Downloads (git-scm.com)
4.	Installed 14.17.0 LTS version of node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/
5.	Open “PowerShell”. “cd” to the directory that you created is step 1. The run the following commands in that directory (only use the text after the command prompt below):
```
PS C:\Users\Username\Documents\Three.js\Prject1\> npm init @vitejs/app
PS C:\Users\Username\Documents\Three.js\Project1\> npm install
PS C:\Users\Username\\Documents\Three.js\Project1\> npm run dev
```
6.	Open Chrome and paste the following url into the browser: http://localhost:3000/
7.	In a few seconds you should see a rendering of the planet Earth appear. You should be able to interact with it.
8.	If you make changes to main.js, the changes immediately take effect in the browser.
9.	Sometimes you need to refresh the browser with \<cntrl\> + \<shift\> + R to get the model to work.
